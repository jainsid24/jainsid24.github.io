          I am a Masters student in Computer Science at Stony Brook University, New York.
          I had a fantastic learning experience as a software engineering intern at Jasmine Universe LLC,
          New York this summer, where I deployed two system device drivers
          and developed PoCs for a ZigBee based Smart Device with lead software team

           I love building things.
           I've filed a patent for "RFID based Smart Shopping Cart".
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for software developer roles where I can work in challenging environments
           amongst technology driven and passionate colleagues.
